## About

TV Pusat Sumber Sekolah (PSS) is a creative school program that helps students learn skills in journalism, media, and hosting. It encourages students to think creatively and critically. However, managing the program across different schools is hard because the team still uses manual methods to collect and track data, which can lead to mistakes and missing information. To solve this, we suggest creating a Management Information System (MIS) that stores all the data in one place, making it easier to find and use. This system will help the team make better decisions, use resources more wisely, and improve the overall success of the TV PSS program.

## Features

- Consolidates all program-related data into a single system for easy access and management
- Tracks and monitors the availability of resources such as equipment and performance metrics across schools
- Simplifies the application process for students by managing form submissions and collecting student information
- Allows users to upload activity content and documents, ensuring that all relevant materials are readily available in the system
- Enables the organization, editing, and deletion of uploaded content to maintain a consistent and up-to-date content library

## Getting Started

Instructions on how to set up and use the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher
- **Apache Maven**: Version 3.6.3 or higher
- **MySQL**: Version 8.0.27 or compatible
- **Web Server**: Apache Tomcat (for deploying the WAR file)
- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any Java-supporting IDE

### Installation

Step-by-step instructions on how to install your project:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository using Git or download the ZIP file and extract it.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the project files.

   ```bash
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

3. **Configure the Database**: Create a new MySQL database and update the `application.properties` file with the database credentials.

   Example configuration:
   ```properties
